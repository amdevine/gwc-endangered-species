    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking at the species added per year, the data seem to be multimodal. Perhaps this could reflect the political climate of the time, and the executive branch's views on protecting endangered and threatened species?\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are more analyses we could pursue, if we wanted to delve more deeply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore the actual `Petition Finding(s)` from the petition data. How successful are petitions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do petitions or FWS scientists have a greater impact on getting species listed under the ESA?\n",
