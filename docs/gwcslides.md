## What is Data Wrangling? ##

<p style="font-size:.7em;margin-bottom:1.5em;">Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling): *Transforming and mapping data from one raw data form into another format with the intent of making it [useful] for a variety of downstream purposes, such as analytics.*</p>

My favorite tools:

- Scripting languages: Python, R, VBA
- Applications: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), Excel, [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html)
- Version control: GitHub

## Jupyter Notebook ##

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
Document that contains executable Python code and Markdown-formatted text

Good for running self-contained analyses

Easily share with others

**[IRkernel](https://irkernel.github.io/)**: Run notebooks with R instead of Python

**[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)**: Converts notebooks to shareable HTML documents

**[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE)**: Run a Jupyter notebook as a slide show

## OpenRefine ##

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
![](img/openrefine.jpg)
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

Powerful tool for cleaning messy data

Complex filtering, sorting, and grouping

Mass editing records

Special language ([GREL](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/General-Refine-Expression-Language)) to filter and edit data with formulas

## R ##

Programming language developed for statistics

Powerful at data manipulation

More intuitive than Python when working with data? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

**[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)**: popular R development software

**[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)**: R library, easily develop web apps to vizualize data

# Endangered Species Data {data-background-image="img/golden-toad.jpg"}

## Environmental Conservation Online System (ECOS)

U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service

Keeps track of species listed as Endangered or Threatened

See Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory analysis: [https://github.com/amdevine/gwc-endangered-species/blob/master/US%20Endangered%20Species%20Data.ipynb](https://github.com/amdevine/gwc-endangered-species/blob/master/US%20Endangered%20Species%20Data.ipynb)
